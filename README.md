This code is no more developped. Check out the new ofxSequence.

# Description #
Hidden Markov Models is a powerful statistical tool for model time-varying pattern. 
Gestures recognition is a good application for this kind of machine learning automatic pattern recognition.
It consists in two phases: supervised learning with examples (training) and recognition (classification).

This C++ project provide a simple graphical user interface for boh training and classification.

It is a projected developped with:

* [OPEN FRAMEWORKS](openframeworks.cc), thanks to the great community
* [ofxhGUI](https://github.com/nkint/ofxhGui), my fork of an event-based graphical interface for OF devlopped by Bernard Geyer
* [Armadillo](C++ linear algebra library), lightweight and fast library for matrix calculi

Hidden Markov Model code is based on [HHM toolbox from Kevin Murph](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html)

# Platform #
For now it is been tested only under Ubuntu 10.10.
